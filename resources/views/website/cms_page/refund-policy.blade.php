            <p><strong>TripTrack Hardware, Tags & Accessories Limited Warranty</strong></p>
            <p>Available in India, the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and the European Union.</p>
            <p>TripTrack provides a <strong>1-year limited warranty</strong> on manufacturing defects from the date of delivery to the original retail purchaser ("Warranty Period"). This warranty applies to defects in material and manufacturing processes but excludes normal wear and tear, fragile components (such as switches, batteries, or casing), and other damages not caused by manufacturing faults.</p>
            <p>If a defect in the TripTrack Device, QR Code Tag, or Accessory arises during the Warranty Period, TripTrack will, at its sole discretion, either repair, replace, or refund the original purchase price upon return of the defective product. Replacements or repairs carry the remaining warranty period or 90 days from the replacement date, whichever is longer.</p>
            <p>This Warranty does not cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Damage caused by misuse, accidents, or unauthorized modifications</li>
                <li>Products purchased from unauthorized resellers</li>
                <li>Failure to follow usage and activation instructions</li>
                <li>Battery depletion beyond the warranty period</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This warranty is in addition to any rights provided under local consumer laws, including the Australian Consumer Law. If you believe you are entitled to a remedy under local law, please contact support at support@triptrack.in.</p>
            <p><strong>TripTrack Refund Policy</strong></p>
            <p>We are confident you'll love your TripTrack products. However, if the product doesn't meet your expectations, the original retail purchaser can return items purchased directly from TripTrack within <strong>15 days</strong> of delivery for a full refund, provided they are in original condition with packaging and proof of purchase. This does not apply to final sale items as specified in the applicable sale terms.</p>
            <p>To initiate a return or warranty claim, please contact our support team with proof of purchase. If your claim is valid, TripTrack will bear the cost of shipping the replacement product to you.</p>
